> An app that tracks accelerometer + gps and visualizes the data over time

This is a quick app that I built for visualizing outdoors go kart performance
(indoor visualizations are worse as the GPS signal is not good enough).

## Installing

Install the app to your phone by running:

```shell
flutter run --release
```

This builds and runs the app on your phone.

## Developing

This is a standard Flutter project, so you can run it in development mode using:

```shell
flutter run
```

You might want to use your IDE to run it to get hot reloads and other features.

### Publishing

This project has not been pulbished to App Store or Google Play yet.

## Features

This is a simple app that:
* Saves all sensor and GPS data to a sqlite file
* It makes effort to visualize that data in different ways
* It's quick and free!

## Contributing

This is probably a small test project, no further development should be assumed.

However if you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a
feature branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.
